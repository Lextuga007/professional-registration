I plan to outline some of the projects/analysis I’ve worked on which include: Joining data across various clinical and non-clinical datasets to build up a complete dataset on patients who have died Venn diagrams to understand the SMI (Serious Mental Illness - a register held by GPs) and CPAs (Care Pathway Approach - “for people in England with severe or complex mental health problems and those who may need services from a number of agencies to support them” 1 kept by the Trust) Smoking prevalence of Mental Health patients (both community and inpatients) compared to the ONS (Office of National Statistics) prevalence figures Improving and delivering the NHS-R Community Introduction to R and R Studio workshop Statistical analysis of surveys collected in the local Pride events Mainining an R package to access the SQL server data in a consistent and tidy way 1.1 Warnings I’ve set this up by using the bookdown package and the template example from RStudio so for a bit it will look slightly odd as it will be my words followed by the template. I had to change the _output.yaml file to replace bookdown::pdf_book: with bookdown::html_book: and remove references to latex because of restrictions on my work laptop. I don’t want to publish pdfs anyway because it’s not always accessible to screen readers so I don’t really need that functionality. 1.2 Licence This is licenced under CCO and I’m choosing to work openly on my registration as this is a collection of my knowledge and work that I feel can only benefit others if it’s shared. Most of it should already be on GitHub and if it’s not, it should be! 1.3 Motivations If I am successful in being accredited then I always wanted to share that learning so why not start early? And if I fail or get corrections, then we can learn from that too. 1.4 Information Governance Any data used in this registration will be generated “synthetic data” and the code to generate it will be available. I may change some code from the original to remove references to data structures that I do not own and have not had confirmed (yet) can be shared openly. 1.5 Corrections If you spot any mistakes, please do let me know through issues or email.

You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 5. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!

These situations will sometimes be non-routine although precedents are likely to have been established before within the team. Demonstrates a critical understanding (including researching) of the organisation and health care environment. What was the situation and analytical challenge? Which tools were available to complete the task? Which tool was selected and why? What were the benefits of using this particular tool? Where there any disadvantages? 3.1.1 Reflective Practice I was asked to find the smoking prevalence for mental health patients in the care of the Trust. Although smoking status had been recorded in two forms over the years the prevalence had never been calculated, only current smokers counted for CQUINs. Also, as the smoking status was not recorded regularly, to work out the yearly prevalence would require assuming smoking status for the years when they had an open referral but no smoking status recorded. I originally only had SQL and Excel as tools to complete this so I used SQL to combine data which counted: an assessment in a referral/inpatient stay an assessment before a referral/inpatient stay and assumed no change in smoking status in the interim period an assessment after a referral/inpatient stay and assumed no change SQL was the only way I could script this logic to make it reproducible but when I was asked to update this I moved to R as this is a more flexible analytical and statistical language. By moving the code to another language I validated my previous logic and I realised it was better to produce a row for each year between assessments and fill down the missing years. I also had mistakenly counted the ages based on the admission dates and, of course, everyone ages each year so I changed the age calculation to be on the first of every year. This isn’t quite accurate but is much closer than my initial approach. I used RMarkdown to produce the workflow to bring the data together, including the ONS smoking prevalence data from their website, manipulate this to create a new dataset and the produce statistics from it. This meant I could write more narrative around the analysis which, when it was in SQL, was comments in the script and could not shared. The downside to using R was only that it takes longer than in SQL due to RAM needs and the function dplyr::fill() used to copy down information where it is missing took a long time; the dataset is a couple of million rows. I could get around this computational slowness by using a package called {data.table} which, whilst I’m not familiar with, is much faster at processing data than my usual package of choice, {dplyr}. I used very little of the {data.table} code to ensure that I did not introduce any errors/bugs that I could not understand. 3.1.2 Evidence Provided Smoking prevalence report Code 3.2 SP1.2 Standard Commentary SP1.2 Have knowledge of a range of statistical/ numerical techniques, procedures acquired through qualification to degree level or equivalent relevant experience Identify statistical techniques being used. How did you get the knowledge of these techniques (formal learning, on-line resources, etc.)? 3.2.1 Reflective Practice For mortality surveillance I used SPC (statistical process control) charts but for much of the analysis of mortality, SPC is not appropriate because of patterns like seasonality or very small numbers (as in the case of suspected/confirmed suicides). For small number analysis I specifically chose to use time between charts in SPC, instead of count (xmr) or proportional charts for analysis as I wanted to see if there had been any decrease in the time between deaths as a pattern that should be monitored. The difficulty with these charts is conveying across to a audience who are familiar with SPCs that a point above the control limits is positive (in this context) as it relates to an increase in length of time between events. In order to check my reasoning on using these charts in this context I have presented my work at various analyst events. 3.2.2 Evidence Provided 3.2.2.1 Mortality I presented this particular presentation at: East Midlands AphA (Association of Professional Healthcare Analysts) branch meeting 1st November 2019 R-Ladies London 30th July 2019 NHS-R Community Conference 4-5th November 2019 lightning talk NHS-R Community I used this presentation to show how I had used R to create a mortality surveillance report.
