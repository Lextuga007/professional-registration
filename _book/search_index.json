I plan to outline some of the projects/analysis Ive worked on which include: Joining data across various clinical and non-clinical datasets to build up a complete dataset on patients who have died Venn diagrams to understand the SMI (Serious Mental Illness - a register held by GPs) and CPAs (Care Pathway Approach - for people in England with severe or complex mental health problems and those who may need services from a number of agencies to support them1 kept by the Trust) Smoking prevalence of Mental Health patients (both community and inpatients) compared to the ONS (Office of National Statistics) prevalence figures Improving and delivering the NHS-R Community Introduction to R and R Studio workshop Statistical analysis of surveys collected in the local Pride events Mainining an R package to access the SQL server data in a consistent and tidy way 1.1 Warnings Ive set this up by using the bookdown package and the template example from RStudio so for a bit it will look slightly odd as it will be my words followed by the template. I had to change the _output.yaml file to replace bookdown::pdf_book: with bookdown::html_book: and remove references to latex because of restrictions on my work laptop. I dont want to publish pdfs anyway because its not always accessible to screen readers so I dont really need that functionality. 1.2 Licence This is licenced under CCO and Im choosing to work openly on my registration as this is a collection of my knowledge and work that I feel can only benefit others if its shared. Most of it should already be on GitHub and if its not, it should be! 1.3 Motivations If I am successful in being accredited then I always wanted to share that learning so why not start early? And if I fail or get corrections, then we can learn from that too. 1.4 Information Governance Any data used in this registration will be generated synthetic data and the code to generate it will be available. I may change some code from the original to remove references to data structures that I do not own and have not had confirmed (yet) can be shared openly. 1.5 Corrections If you spot any mistakes, please do let me know through issues or email.

You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 5. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!

These situations will sometimes be non-routine although precedents are likely to have been established before within the team.

Which tools were available to complete the task? Which tool was selected and why? What were the benefits of using this particular tool? Where there any disadvantages? I was asked to find the smoking prevalence for mental health patients in the care of the Trust. Although smoking status had been recorded in two forms over the years the prevalence had never been calculated, only current smokers counted for CQUINs. Also, as the smoking status was not recorded regularly, to work out the yearly prevalence would require assuming smoking status for the years when they had an open referral but no smoking status recorded. I originally only had SQL and Excel as tools to complete this so I used SQL to combine data which counted: an assessment in a referral/inpatient stay an assessment before a referral/inpatient stay and assumed no change in smoking status in the interim period an assessment after a referral/inpatient stay and assumed no change SQL was the only way I could script this logic to make it reproducible but when I was asked to update this I moved to R as this is a more flexible analytical and statistical language. By moving the code to another language I validated my previous logic and I realised it was better to produce a row for each year between assessments and fill down the missing years. I also had mistakenly counted the ages based on the admission dates and, of course, everyone ages each year so I changed the age calculation to be on the first of every year. This isnt quite accurate but is much closer than my initial approach. I used RMarkdown to produce the workflow to bring the data together, including the ONS smoking prevalence data, manipulate this to create a new dataset and the produce statistics from it. This meant I could write more narrative around the analysis which, when it was in SQL was left as comments in the script and not shared. The downside to using R was only that it takes longer in R than in SQL, due to RAM needs, to fill the missing data if the dataset is a couple of million rows. I got around this by using a package called {data.table} which, whilst Im not familiar with, is much faster at processing data than my usual package of choice, {dplyr}. 3.2 SP1.2 Standard Commentary Reflective Practice Evidence Provided SP1.2 Have knowledge of a range of statistical/ numerical techniques, procedures acquired through qualification to degree level or equivalent relevant experience Identify statistical techniques being used.
