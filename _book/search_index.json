I had to change the _output.yaml file to replace bookdown::pdf_book: with bookdown::html_book: and remove references to latex because of restrictions on my work laptop. I dont want to publish pdfs anyway because its not always accessible to screen readers so I dont really need that functionality. 1.1 Licence This is licenced under CCO and Im choosing to work openly on my registration as this is a collection of my knowledge and work that I feel can only benefit others if its shared. Most of it should already be on GitHub and if its not, it should be! 1.2 Motivations If I am successful in being accredited then I always wanted to share that learning so why not start early? And if I fail or get corrections, then we can learn from that too. 1.3 Information Governance Any data used in this registration will be generated synthetic data and the code to generate it will be available. I may change some code from the original to remove references to data structures that I do not own and have not had confirmed (yet) can be shared openly. 1.4 Corrections If you spot any mistakes, please do let me know through issues or email.

You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!

You should consider analytical projects or pieces of work where you have taken a business problem or question and translated this into an analytical task. This should demonstrate understanding of the question, choice of data with justification and limitations, appropriate presentation that addresses the question, understanding of what the data show and conclusions to be drawn given said limitations.

These situations will sometimes be non-routine although precedents are likely to have been established before within the team.
