Also, as the smoking status was not recorded regularly, to work out the yearly prevalence would require assuming smoking status for the years when they had an open referral but no smoking status recorded.

By moving the code to another language I validated my previous logic and I realised it was better to produce a row for each year between assessments and fill down the missing years. I also had mistakenly counted the ages based on the admission dates and, of course, everyone ages each year so I changed the age calculation to be on the first of every year. This isn't quite accurate but is much closer than my initial approach.                                                                                                                              |                   |
