# Warnings

I've set this up by using the bookdown package and the template example from [RStudio](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown-demo) so for a bit it will look slightly odd as it will be my words followed by the template. 

I had to change the _output.yaml file to replace `bookdown::pdf_book:` with `bookdown::html_book:` and remove references to `latex` because of restrictions on my work laptop. I don't want to publish pdfs anyway because it's not always accessible to screen readers so I don't really need that functionality.

## Licence

This is licenced under CCO and I'm choosing to work openly on my registration as this is a collection of my knowledge and work that I feel can only benefit others if it's shared. Most of it should already be on GitHub and if it's not, it should be!

## Motivations

If I am successful in being accredited then I always wanted to share that learning so why not start early? And if I fail or get corrections, then we can learn from that too.

## Information Governance

Any data used in this registration will be generated "synthetic data" and the code to generate it will be available. 

I may change some code from the original to remove references to data structures that I do not own and have not had confirmed (yet) can be shared openly. 

## Corrections

If you spot any mistakes, please do let me know through [issues](https://github.com/Lextuga007/professional-registration/issues) or [email](mailto:zoe.turner2@nottshc.nhs.uk).
